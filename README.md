# About the Project:

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1. Given an image, determine if the image contains defect or not, and if the image contains defect, output the bounding box coordinates of the defect.
2. The image can contain multiple bounding boxes (i.e it can can contain multiple defects)



## About the files: -

1. Documentation.pdf : Contains the discription and our approach for solving the problem
2. Final_DefectType_GoodBoys.csv: Contains the label whether an image is defective or not (we only took 250 images, because of the memory constraints)
3. Presentation for the CV Hackathon.pdf: Contains the presentation for our approach
4. bbox_cv_hackathon_resnet_pytorch.py : Contains the python file for the prediction of the bounding box (written in PyTorch)
5. defect_prediction.py: Contains the python file for the prediction of the defect of the image (written in Tensorflow)

## Models used:

* The model used are:
1. ResNet 18
2. ResNet 50
